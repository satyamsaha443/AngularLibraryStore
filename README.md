For a corporate presentation, the problem statement for the inventory management application could be framed as follows:

"Our organization currently faces significant challenges in managing and tracking our inventory effectively. The absence of a comprehensive and integrated inventory management system leads to issues such as stock discrepancies, inefficient product data handling, and difficulties in monitoring stock levels, impacting our operational efficiency and bottom line. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a robust inventory management application. This solution will feature secure user authentication with role-based access control, a centralized database for all product information, barcode scanning for easy product updates, and advanced search and filter capabilities. Key functionalities will include real-time stock tracking, automated low stock alerts, support for product images, and comprehensive supplier management. The application will also facilitate the creation and management of purchase and sales orders, implement FIFO and LIFO inventory valuation methods, and offer detailed reporting and analytics. Additionally, it will support data import and export in various formats and feature a dynamic, role-adjusted user interface. The aim is to streamline our inventory processes, enhance data accuracy, and improve overall decision-making in inventory management."
